# Chinese-Divination
Divination using Yi Jing(I Ching)

Author: Bowen Li and Can Zhao

zhanbu.py is the main script, while guaci provides with description for divination result, which is written in Chinese.

NOTE: there are three golden rules for Chinese-Divination using Yi Jing:

1. If you have little trust on it, then do not divine.

2. If you are asking an immoral question, then do not divine.
 
3. If you already have an answer in your mind, then do not divine.
 


To Install: Just put zhanbu.py and guaci in one folder. eg. directory/Divination/

To Run:

Step 1: Think over what question you would like to ask. Note that you can only divine the same question once in three months.

Step 2: Open terminal. cd directory/Divination/

Step 3: python ./zhanbu.py

The output answer is only for the question you asked this time. All the 64 possible answers are directly coming from Yi Jing. If you need explanation, please find it yourself.
