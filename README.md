Author: Bowen Li and Can Zhao

Date: March, 2016


zhanbu.py is the main script, while guaci provides with description for divination result, which is written in Chinese.

NOTE: there are three golden rules for Chinese-Divination using Yi Jing:

1. If you have little trust on it, then do not divine.

2. If you are asking an immoral question, then do not divine.
 
3. If you already have an answer in your mind, then do not divine.
 


To Run:

Step 1: Put zhanbu.py and guaci in one folder. eg. directory/Divination/

Step 2: Open terminal

Step 3: cd directory/Divination/

Step 4: python ./zhanbu.py
